# testing_linux

These are some testing programs for the Linux operating system.

  - `assembly/`: Hello-world programs in assembly

  - `ipc/`: Programs that perform interprocess communication (IPC)

  - `network/`: Programs that perform network communication using the socket API

  - `glibc.c`: A program that prints the version of the GNU C library on the system

## Operating systems

Linux is an operating system kernel, designed to be a replacement of the UNIX system kernel. It needs a set of user space UNIX programs to form a complete operating system. Usually the set of programs is GNU software. Therefore Linux operating systems are usually also called GNU/Linux.

It's also possible to use the Linux kernel with non-UNIX user space programs, as in the Android operating system.

GNU is another operating system, designed to be a clone of UNIX. However, GNU's own kernel (Hurd) is immature. So generally GNU/Linux is used instead of GNU/Hurd.

GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd are both very similar to UNIX by design. macOS is a type (a descendent) of UNIX. So they are all very similar.
